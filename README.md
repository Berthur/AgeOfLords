# AgeOfLords
An old school project of mine: A semi-RTS game inspired by games like Stronghold 2 and Age of Empires.

This was my attempt at familiarizing myself with Scala/Java Swing and it was my first "real-time" game. One of my main focuses was the AI of the opponent, which builds its buildings and recruits its troops in an attempt to defeat the player.
