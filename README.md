# AgeOfLords
An old school project of mine: A semi-RTS game inspired by games like Stronghold 2 and Age of Empires.

This was my attempt at familiarizing myself with Scala/Java Swing and it was my first "real-time" game. One of my main focuses was the AI of the opponent, which builds its buildings and recruits its troops in an attempt to defeat the player.

NB! I do not take any credit for the audio in this game, nor do any audio files take part in the project's licence. They are only here as an example of what sort of audio this game could have, and the sound files could be changed at any time.
